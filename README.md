## Review

Congratulations! Using the OWASP Top 10’s list of the most critical security risks to web applications as a guide, you are now able to protect your users, and yourself, from threats to your Node.js applications. The goal of this unit was to focus on SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks as well as insecure JavaScript coding practices.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

- Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection Attacks
- Avoid unsafe JavaScript coding practices
- Explain the basics of Remediation and Incident Response

Having completed this content, you know how to make your Node.js and Express applications safer from malicious actors and cyber attacks.

If you are interested in learning more about these topics, here are some additional resources:

- Course: Introduction to Cybersecurity
- Skill Path: Securing Express Applications
- Course: User Authentication & Authorization in Express

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.
