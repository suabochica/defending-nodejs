## XSS

A web application allows users to post public messages that are displayed to other users. These messages are saved in a backend database. Unfortunately, it appears as if a hacker has figured out a way to inject arbitrary JavaScript into these messages. Their code impacts any user who loads the public messages. What type of XSS attack would this be considered?

1. Dynamic XSS
2. DOM Based XSS
3. Stored XSS
4. Reflected XSS

While exploring a site you find you a value in the URL is reflected back to you. After some careful fuzzing you find you can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the site via this URL. The payload does not appear to be a result of client side code. What type of XSS attack is this?

1. Mirrored XSS
2. DOM Based XSS
3. Stored XSS
4. Reflected XSS

## CORS

How does CORS manage requests from external resources?

1. By making a call to an external server.
2. By adding new HTTP headers to the standard list of headers (e.g. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`).
3. By adding a new HTTP footers to the standard list of footers (`Access-Control-Request-Method`).
4. By allowing OAuth.
