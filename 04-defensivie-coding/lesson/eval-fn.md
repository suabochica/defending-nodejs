## The eval Function: Dangers and Alternatives

The `eval()` function in JavaScript takes a string as an argument and executes it as Javascript source code. Consider the following examples:

```js
// This user input causes an infinite loop to run
const user_input = "while(true) ;";
eval(user_input);
```

```js
// This user input closes the application
const user_input = "process.exit(0)";
eval(user_input);
```

The functions, `setInterval()`, `setTimeout()`, and `new Function()` use `eval()` in their implementations, and should be used with the same caution.

We might be able to mitigate this risk with `npm` packages like `safe-eval` and `expression-eval`. Both allow us to limit which methods and properties are available to `eval()`. Strings passed to `safe-eval` must be an expression, not a statement. This prevents injected code from being executed. The code below, for example, will throw an error since it does not have access to the `process` object.

```js
// Using safeEval will throw an error
const user_input = "process.exit(0)";
safeEval(user_input);
```

Take a look at their documentation for more examples!

    Note: While packages like `safe-eval` may be safer than using `eval`, they may still contain vulnerabilities. 

Best practices with eval are:

- Avoid using it altogether!
- If you must use it, use a safer version, and only allow trusted, non-user input.

You should always do your own research when exploring packages to use in your applications.


## The exec method: Dangers and Alternatives

In this exercise, we will discuss the `exec()` method, its risks, and alternatives.

The `exec()` method takes a string as an argument and runs it as a shell command, enabling shell syntax within JavaScript. The danger is that unrestricted commands can access, modify, and delete files. For example:

```js
user_input = "cat *.js";
exec(user_input);
```

`exec()`, combined with the user input above, allows an attacker to print out all the JavaScript files in the current directory.

The `execFile()` method is an alternative that works similarly to exec() but requires separation of the commands and its arguments. This prevents piped commands and path variable access. Consider the following example:

```js
import { exec, execFile } from "child_process";

// Spawns a shell with the input as is
exec("ls -lah /tmp");

// Requires a command and specified arguments to execute
execFile("ls", ["-lah", "/tmp"]);
```

The arguments for the command `ls` must be separated in the `execFile()` method call. This separation ensures that an attacker cannot inject their malicious commands. Whereas `exec` will allow for additional unintended commands in the input, `execFile` will detect an error.
