## The eval Function: Dangers and Alternatives

The `eval()` function in JavaScript takes a string as an argument and executes it as Javascript source code. Consider the following examples:

```js
// This user input causes an infinite loop to run
const user_input = "while(true) ;";
eval(user_input);
```

```js
// This user input closes the application
const user_input = "process.exit(0)";
eval(user_input);
```

The functions, `setInterval()`, `setTimeout()`, and `new Function()` use `eval()` in their implementations, and should be used with the same caution.

We might be able to mitigate this risk with `npm` packages like `safe-eval` and `expression-eval`. Both allow us to limit which methods and properties are available to `eval()`. Strings passed to `safe-eval` must be an expression, not a statement. This prevents injected code from being executed. The code below, for example, will throw an error since it does not have access to the `process` object.

```js
// Using safeEval will throw an error
const user_input = "process.exit(0)";
safeEval(user_input);
```

Take a look at their documentation for more examples!

    Note: While packages like `safe-eval` may be safer than using `eval`, they may still contain vulnerabilities. 

Best practices with eval are:

- Avoid using it altogether!
- If you must use it, use a safer version, and only allow trusted, non-user input.

You should always do your own research when exploring packages to use in your applications.


## The exec method: Dangers and Alternatives

In this exercise, we will discuss the `exec()` method, its risks, and alternatives.

The `exec()` method takes a string as an argument and runs it as a shell command, enabling shell syntax within JavaScript. The danger is that unrestricted commands can access, modify, and delete files. For example:

```js
user_input = "cat *.js";
exec(user_input);
```

`exec()`, combined with the user input above, allows an attacker to print out all the JavaScript files in the current directory.

The `execFile()` method is an alternative that works similarly to exec() but requires separation of the commands and its arguments. This prevents piped commands and path variable access. Consider the following example:

```js
import { exec, execFile } from "child_process";

// Spawns a shell with the input as is
exec("ls -lah /tmp");

// Requires a command and specified arguments to execute
execFile("ls", ["-lah", "/tmp"]);
```

The arguments for the command `ls` must be separated in the `execFile()` method call. This separation ensures that an attacker cannot inject their malicious commands. Whereas `exec` will allow for additional unintended commands in the input, `execFile` will detect an error.

## Dangers and secure use of the file system (fs) module

The file system, or fs, module in Node.js enables file system operations. It gives us access to methods like:

- chmod() to change file permissions
- mkdir() to create directories
- rmdir() to delete directories
- And many more

The `fs` module coupled with improperly sanitized user input gives attackers access to our entire file system and exposes it to path traversal and file inclusion vulnerabilities. Take a look at the code below:

```js
const user_input = "./example.txt";
fs.unlinkSync(user_input);
```

The above example uses `unlink()` to delete the file defined by the user’s input. It could be any file on our system! To mitigate the risk, we can tweak our code to restrict traversal scope to a directory of our choice:

```js
const user_input = "example.txt"
const root_directory = process.cwd();    // Hard-code path to restrict scope
const filePath = path.join(root_directory , fileName);
fs.unlinkSync(filePath);
```

We use the `join()` method of the `path` method to combine our desired directory with the user-provided file name. Hiding the directory the server is operating on makes it tougher to reach valuable information.


## Danger an secure use of regular expressions

Regular Expressions are used in almost every single programming language to validate whether user input adheres to an expected condition. Attackers can make use of insecure regex expressions to trigger a Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

The RegEx engine can take a large amount of time on poorly defined Regex expressions. Consider the RegEx `([0-9]+)+\#`. The table below shows how the number of backtracking steps increases exponentially as the location of the unmatched character increases.

|        String        | Number of Digits | Number of Steps |
|:--------------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| 123#                 | 3                | 6               |
| 123456789123456789…# | 180              | 6               |
| 1c#                  | 1                | 5               |
| 1234567o#            | 7                | 755             |
| 123456789123456d#    | 15               | 196587          |
| 1234567891234567e#   | 16               | TIMEOUT ERROR   |

To prevent this danger, we can use the `validator` npm package. It provides a library of string validators and sanitizers for things like IP addresses, emails, and phone numbers. For Regex expression we must write ourselves, we can use tools like the `safe-regex` npm package to detect dangerous regular expressions.

We encourage you to take a look at some examples in the `safe-regex` documentation.

## Secure Your Code: Strict Mode

Now that you have learned about some dangerous functions and regular expressions to avoid, let’s learn about some defensive tools. One of them is JavaScript’s strict mode. Using strict mode throws errors that would otherwise be silent, which can help reveal vulnerabilities. To invoke strict mode, simply put "use strict"; in single or double quotes on top of your JavaScript file.

For example, strict mode catches assignments to undefined variables:

```js
// Runs fine without strict mode
x = "codecademy";
```

```js
// Throws “ReferenceError” with strict mode
"use strict";
x = "codecademy";
```

```js
// Runs fine with strict mode if the variable is declared with let, var, or const
"use strict";
var x = "codecademy";
```

We are going to use strict mode to find the errors in the workspace code!

## Secure Your Code: Static Code Analysis

Static Code Analysis evaluates a code without executing it. A lint, or linter, is a static code analysis tool used to improve source code by finding and flagging programming errors, bugs, and patterns that may compromise security. Some of the most popular JavaScript linters are:

- ESLint
- JSLint
- JSHint

We can customize the linter rules to fit our needs using configuration files or third-party plugins. `eslint-plugin-security` is a plugin that adds rules to detect several security vulnerabilities including all of the aforementioned security risks in this lesson.

Linter configuration and usage are beyond the scope of this introductory lesson, but we can see some of their power in the following instructions.
