What causes a regular expression in JavaScript to become unresponsive and thus potentially be used to trigger a Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)?

a. The lengt of the input string.
b. The location of the unmatched character in an input string.

What Node.js module can lead to both path traversal and file inclusion vulnerabilities?

a. `process`
b. `child_process`
c. `fs`
d. `console`

How does the npm package safe-eval mitigate the risk of using eval()?

a. `safe-eval` check whether the JavaScript code is safe to execute.
b. `safe-eval` prevents the Node process from crashing.
c. `safe-eval` executes all code while preventing malicius code from being executed.
d. `safe-eval` limits the methods and properties available to th code being executed.

How can we ensure bad actors cannot exploit the fs module vulnerabilities when using user input as an argument?

a. Define a path restrict `fs`'s file traversal scope.
b. Change the permissions of the files and directories you don't want the attacker to access.
c. Use `path.join(user_input)` as the argument instead.
d. Use the asynchronous version of `fs` methods.
