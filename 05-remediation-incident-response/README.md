# Remediation and Incident Response

> In this article, you will lear how organizations respond when things go wrong.

## What we will be learning

In Cybersecurity, the term incident is when something bad happens, like a breach or policy violation, that harms or potentially harms the security of a system. While a big part of security is preventing incidents from happening in the first place, the reality is that sooner or later, there’s going to be an incident.

Today, we’ll be learning about how organizations respond to incidents and threats that they discover, and how to proceed if you discover one. We’ll also be frequently referencing NIST (the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology). NIST runs the Computer Security Research Center (CSRC), whose recommendations and guides are highly respected within the industry.

## Remediation

NIST defines remediation as “The act of mitigating a vulnerability or a threat”. In simple terms, remediation is simply “the process of fixing a security issue”. It could be patching a vulnerability in a piece of software, removing malware from an infected computer, or kicking a malicious attacker out of a network. Not all remediation comes as the result of an incident; arguably the best remediation happens before the security issue can evolve into an incident.

## Incident Response

### What is Incident Response?

NIST defines incident response as “The mitigation of violations of security policies and recommended practices.”, but a simpler definition might be “everything that needs to happen to investigate and recover from an incident”.

Imagine a company is a bank: It has preventative security systems in the form of an alarm and security guards. An incident would be if bank robbers broke in anyway, and incident response would be the police responding to the alarm, the subsequent forensic investigation, repairing the damage done by the robbers, recovering stolen assets, etc… In short, incident response is a big job that involves a lot of different people with different areas of expertise.

### The Incident Response Lifecycle

Incident response begins before an incident even occurs, with preparations to ensure that an organization is able to respond quickly when an incident does occur. These preparations can include training, ensuring access to tools, and creating incident response plans that contain details about what to do when an incident happens.

When an incident is detected, lots of things happen. The security team’s primary concerns will usually be analysis, containment, and remediation. Other groups within an organization will have their own tasks, such as handling disclosure, communicating with law enforcement, etc. In some cases, usually involving cyberattacks, remediation may be delayed to allow investigators to gather information without tipping the attackers off.

After an incident, an organization will conduct reviews of what happened, and use that knowledge to improve security and procedures, to prevent similar incidents, and respond more effectively to incidents in the future. Depending on the nature of the incident, the organization may need to dedicate additional resources to recovering from the incident; data, software, and even hardware may need to be repaired or replaced.

### A Hypothetical Scenario

Let’s look at an imaginary company responding to an incident: a ransomware attack. The ransomware was quickly detected and isolated before it could spread to more than a few machines, but there’s still a lot to do.

#### The Security Team

The security team is investigating how the malware got in, making sure it can’t come back, and collecting malware samples to be analysed. They’re also investigating what exactly the malware did: if it stole information in addition to encrypting it for ransom, they need to know. If the analysis yields information about who is responsible, it can be passed onto law enforcement. Because the attack was small, law enforcement isn’t directly involved, but the security team is still communicating with them.

#### IT, PR, and Legal

The IT team is busy replacing the computers that have been taken offline, and restoring clean backups, while the PR team prepares a press release on the breach. Members of the legal team are busy making sure that the company has proof they did their due diligence for security.

### Incident Response Playbooks

Incidents can be chaotic and stressful, and aren’t a good time to try to formulate a plan of action. That’s why organizations create what’s called an Incident Response Playbook that contains procedures outlining what needs to happen to respond to an incident. These playbooks contain information on what constitutes an incident, what procedures should be enacted and by who, who needs to be contacted, etc…

Even if you’re not part of a security team, it’s not a bad idea to familiarize yourself with your organization’s incident response playbook. Knowing what to do during an incident, or who to contact if you discover something suspicious, can be important.


## Conclusion

Incident response is a major part of cybersecurity. It’s impossible to completely prevent incidents, so organizations need the capability to effectively respond to them when they do happen.

Incident response is more than just what happens during an incident; it’s also making sure that proper preparations are in place beforehand, and working afterwards to improve security for the future.

NIST is a fantastic resource for cybersecurity in general. In addition to general cybersecurity frameworks that organizations can use and adapt, NIST has a [detailed guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) on establishing and maintaining incident response capability.
